Identify over one hundred different dog breeds with your smartphone.

This application will not run on devices with less than 1 GB of RAM.

If you like this app consider buying the premium version which supports the identification of more than two hundred different dog breeds with much higher accuracy.

Click the camera button or load an image from the gallery to identify a dog in a single picture. Activate continuous predictions and keep the dog in the circle to get predictions directly from the video stream. The app works best for high quality images loaded from the gallery.

The application reports up to three predictions with highest confidence. Please treat the output only as a suggestion.

Based on an extended version of the Stanford Dogs Dataset.
